# Simon-Ehrlich Wager

A visualization of the price data used to settle the [Simon-Ehrlich wager][wager].

## Data
The price data for the five metals used in the wager comes from the [United States Geological Survey][data].

To update the data, simply replace metals.tsv with an updated file. One column must be named `Year`, all other columns will be pivoted so that their column title ends up as a `type` property, and the value of that column becomes the value for a `price` property.

You'll need to have [d3-dsv][dsv] and [ndjson-cli][ndjson] installed.

To generate a new JSON file simply run
```
$ yarn run prepare
```
